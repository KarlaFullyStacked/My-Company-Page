# Company Homepage Project

## Overview

In this project, I designed and built the layout for a company's homepage using Flexbox. I chose to create a new webpage based on myself and I had full control over the content and design of the page. This project helped apply Flexbox for creating a responsive and flexible layout.

## Project Requirements

1. **Content:**
   - **Title and Logo/Splash Image:** Include a title and a logo or splash image at the top of the page.
   - **Mission Statement or Company Description:** Add a brief description or mission statement about the company.
   - **Products Section:** Display a list or set of images and titles representing the companyâ€™s products.
   - **Employees Section:** Include a section describing some of the company's employees or teammates.

2. **Flexbox Layout:**
   - Utilize Flexbox for layout styling to take advantage of easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows, and great styling for repeated elements.
   - Implement Flexbox to:
     - Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
     - Display company products in a flexible layout that adapts to screen size changes.
     - Showcase company employees in a flexible manner.

3. **Styling:**
   - **Custom Styles:** Use Flexbox for layout and apply custom styles for colours, fonts, borders, and padding.
   - **Colour Scheme:** Customise your colour scheme with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colours.
   - **Fonts:** Integrate fonts from the Google Fonts API.
   - **Images:** Use custom images for your site. Consider using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for high-quality images.

4. **Inspiration:**
   - Feel free to explore our example site for inspiration or to see how Flexbox is used. Your site can and should look different, so get creative with your design!
